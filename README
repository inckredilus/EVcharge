README file for EVcharge 

This project is a React-based web application for logging electric vehicle (EV) charging sessions. 
It provides a user interface to start, edit and complete a logs of charging sessions, 
and it sends the logged data to a backend server via POST requests in CSV format.

The backend server is expected to be running a CGI script (write_csv.cgi) that accepts 
the CSV data and processes it accordingly. 

This implemewntation distributes the React app as static files (HTML, JS, CSS) 
that can be served by a web server, here busybox running on Termux on an Android device.

The CGI script is expected to be served on the same device, here lighttp listening on port 8090.
(busybox Android version did not seem to be able to handle CGI scripts, but lighttp on Termux did fine.)

Update script in ./tools/ finished. Project regenerated 2025-12-04
Files written and backups stored at: evcharge_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS

Next suggested steps:
  1) Inspect files and run a local build to verify:
       npm install
       npm run build

  2) Serve the dist/ locally to test (on PC):
       npx serve -s dist
     or
       python3 -m http.server 8000 -d dist

  3) If everything looks good, commit & push to git:
       git add .
       git commit -m "regen: full app regeneration — update BACK, SHOW, validation, layout and defaults"
       git push

Notes:
- The script does NOT touch node_modules or package.json.
- It backups replaced files into  so you can restore if needed.
